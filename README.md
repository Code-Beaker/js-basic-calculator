# Basic JavaScript Calculator App

This is a basic calculator app. I made this while following along Ania Kubow's [tutorial](https://youtu.be/szDQX2dPmns?si=RSH0TgSkZfTB-kLY) on YouTube.

This is a very basic project and I know it has many flaws. But, I built this as part of my learning process and I'll make something better after advancing my knowledge.
